DOM Helpers was born out of a deep love for **vanilla JavaScript**.

Like many developers, I explored frameworks such as React and Vue. I enjoyed working with them, especially their reactivity systems. But over time, I realized something important: I wasn’t abandoning JavaScript because it was weak — I was leaving because **managing complex projects in plain JavaScript becomes hard**.

I didn’t agree with the idea that the solution was to abandon JavaScript altogether.

Instead, I chose a different path.

  

## Enhancing JavaScript, Not Replacing It

DOM Helpers was created to **enhance JavaScript, not replace it**.  
It is built on native browser APIs, with no heavy abstractions that hide what’s really happening.

Every helper exists to make JavaScript **more manageable, more expressive, and more delightful to work with**, while keeping you close to the language itself.

  

## More Than a Library

This project is not just a library.

It is also a **learning platform**.

When you use DOM Helpers, you are not learning a new language or a complex framework — you are **strengthening your understanding of JavaScript**. You can see how things work under the hood:

- how the DOM updates  
- how reactivity is implemented  
- how data flows  

The goal is not only productivity, but **growth as a JavaScript developer**.

  

## Open Source & Community-Driven

DOM Helpers is **free and open source**, and it always will be.

I maintain it with care and passion, and I do my best to keep it simple, transparent, and educational. However, like all open-source projects, it grows and survives through the **community**.

If DOM Helpers helps you:

- learn JavaScript more deeply  
- enjoy coding again without heavy frameworks  
- build better projects with confidence  

you can support the project in many ways:

- contributing code, ideas, or documentation  
- reporting issues or suggesting improvements  
- sponsoring the project to help with long-term maintenance  

Every contribution — big or small — helps keep DOM Helpers **alive, open, and evolving**.

  

Thank you for believing in JavaScript.  
Thank you for being part of this journey.
