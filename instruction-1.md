# Library Analysis Instructions

## Primary Task

Read and analyze all source files located in the following folders:

* `src/core/`
* `src/enhancers/`
* `src/conditions/`
* `src/reactive/`

Your first task is to fully understand the library by carefully examining how these modules are structured, how they interact, and the responsibilities of each folder.

## Analysis Focus Points

While reading the files, pay attention to:

* The purpose of each folder and why it exists
* The core abstractions and patterns used
* Public APIs vs internal helpers
* How state, conditions, enhancers, and reactivity are connected
* Design decisions and architectural intent

## Important Guidelines

**Do not generate documentation or refactor anything yet.** First, build a clear mental model of the entire library.

Once understanding is complete, confirm readiness and wait for the next instruction.
